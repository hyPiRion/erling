Erling is an IRC bot which will be written in Erlang. 

You may wonder why I'd bother to write yet another IRC bot. The main reason is
simply because I belive Erlang's programming model is extremely well suited for
IRC bots, and because I'd like to learn how to design an Erlang program
properly.

## Usage

The main idea is that you'd only install Erlang and Rebar and fire up some
config files, then you're done. We'll get to the specific details in some time I
suppose.
