Erling is an IRC bot which will be written in Erlang. It is currently a work in
progress, although work has staled lately. Development may be more active when I
am about to work with Erlang in other projects, and want to keep my skills
polished.

You may wonder why I'd bother to write yet another IRC bot. The main reason is
simply because I belive Erlang's programming model is extremely well suited for
IRC bots, and because I'd like to learn how to design an Erlang program
properly.

## Usage

The main idea is that you'd only install Erlang and Rebar and fire up some
config files, then you're done. We'll get to the specific details in some time I
suppose.
